Dog and Cat Prediction Using CNN
This project is a simple implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats. The model is trained using Keras and TensorFlow, and it can predict whether an image contains a dog or a cat.

Project Structure
dataset/: Contains the training and testing datasets.
training_set/: Folder with training images of cats and dogs.
test_set/: Folder with testing images of cats and dogs.
single_prediction/: Contains images for single predictions.
model.py: Python script to define, train, and save the CNN model.
predict.py: Python script to load the trained model and make predictions on new images.
README.md: This file.


Requirements:
Python 3.x
Keras
TensorFlow
